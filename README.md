#Measure-o-tron5000
 
 
 The measure-o-tron5000 is a device that measures: humidity; temperature; your position; distance (up to one and a half metres) and air pressure. You would want to use the measure - 0 - tron5000 because it will help you measure five things in one. We use the Sense Hat, an ultra sonic range finder and a GPS.
 
 You could use the measure-o-tron5000 to: measure rugby pitch sizes; measure short distances like a table tennis table more accurately than a ruler; perform various experiments in science and record accurate weather conditions when someone broke a world record. 
 
  You trigger the measurements by moving the joystick (one movement means air pressure, another means ultra sonic range finder and so on). The results of the measurements are displayed on the Sense HatÕs eight-by-eight LED matrix. 
 
 We would also like to add a special 3D printed case to fit the design of the measure-o-tron5000. We would change the joystick triggering the measurements to when you pull the joystick left the picture on the eight-by-eight LED matrix changes from being a temperature-related picture to a position-related picture. Also, when you press the joystick it triggers the picture. 
 
 The measure-o-tron5000 will cost £75 when you buy it in the shops.
